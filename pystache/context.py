    Provides dictionary-like access to a stack of zero or more items.

    Instances of this class are meant to act as the rendering context
    when rendering mustache templates in accordance with mustache(5).

    Instances encapsulate a private stack of objects and dictionaries.
    Querying the stack for the value of a key queries the items in the
    stack in order from last-added objects to first (last in, first out).

    See the docstrings of the methods of this class for more information.

    # option for enabling a strict mode).
    def __init__(self, *items):
        """
        Construct an instance, and initialize the private stack.

        The *items arguments are the items with which to populate the
        initial stack.  Items in the argument list are added to the
        stack in order so that, in particular, items at the end of
        the argument list are queried first when querying the stack.

        Each item should satisfy the following condition:

        * If the item implements __getitem__(), it should also implement
          __contains__().  Failure to implement __contains__() will cause
          an AttributeError to be raised when the item is queried during
          calls to self.get().

          Python dictionaries, in particular, satisfy this condition.
          An item satisfying this condition we informally call a "mapping
          object" because it shares some characteristics of the Mapping
          abstract base class (ABC) in Python's collections package:
          http://docs.python.org/library/collections.html#collections-abstract-base-classes

          It is not necessary for an item to implement __getitem__().
          In particular, an item can be an ordinary object with no
          mapping-like characteristics.

        Query the stack for the given key, and return the resulting value.

        Querying for a key queries items in the stack in order from last-
        added objects to first (last in, first out).  The value returned
        is the value of the key for the first item for which the item
        contains the key.  If the key is not found in any item in the
        stack, then this method returns the default value.  The default
        value defaults to None.

        Querying an item in the stack is done in the following way:

        (1) If the item defines __getitem__() and the item contains the
            key (i.e. __contains__() returns True), then the corresponding
            value is returned.
        (2) Otherwise, the method looks for an attribute with the same
            name as the key.  If such an attribute exists, the value of
            this attribute is returned.  If the attribute is callable,
            however, the attribute is first called with no arguments.
        (3) If there is no attribute with the same name as the key, then
            the key is considered not found in the item.
